# TurtleGo

*Turtle drawing app in Go.*

Turtle is a very rudimentary drawing app where you move a cursor with arrow keys to draw.
As you move the cursor you can toggle a drawing pen up or down by pressing spacebar.
When the pen is down the cursor will leave behind a trail, when the pen is up the cursor will not
leave a trail.
